# Refactoring / Extract Method

Hey there! We're [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com), a design and
development consultancy that brings your digital product ideas to life.
We also love to share what we learn.

This coding exercise comes from [Upcase](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase),
the online learning platform we run. It's part of the
[Refactoring](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/refactoring) course and is just one small sample of all
the great material available on Upcase, so be sure to visit and check out the rest.

## Exercise Intro

If there's a group of expressions (or even a single expression) whose intention can be better described with a single, concise name, it's a sign that it can be extracted as a method.

In this exercise, you'll find several opportunities to do exactly that.

If you like, you can [watch an example from The Weekly Iteration](https://upcase.com/videos/ruby-science-extract-method).


## Instructions

To start, you'll want to clone and run the setup script for the repo

    git clone git@github.com:thoughtbot-upcase-exercises/extract-method.git
    cd extract-method
    bin/setup

Within the `print` method of the `ReceiptPrinter` class, extract some code out as methods.

Remember to:

* Give each method a name that best describes its role within `print`;
* Run the tests via `rake` to make sure they're all still passing.
